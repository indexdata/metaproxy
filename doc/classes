A Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the YP2 Classes
========================================

Introductory Notes
------------------

In general, classes seem to be named big-endianly, so that
"FactoryFilter" is not a filter for factories, but a factory that
produces filters, and "FactoryStatic" is a factory for the statically
registered filters (as opposed to those that are dynamically loaded).


Classes
=======

yp::FactoryFilter
-----------------

A factory class that exists primarily to provide the create() method,
which takes the name of a filter class as its argument and returns a
new filter of that type.  To enable this, the factory must first be
populated by calling add_creator() for static filters (this is done by
the FactoryStatic class, see below) and add_creator_dyn() for filters
loaded dynamically.

yp2::FactoryStatic
------------------

A subclass of FactoryFilter which is responsible for registering all
the statically defined filter types.  It does this by knowing about
all those filters' structures, which are listed in its constructor.
Merely instantiating this class registers all the static classes.  It
is for the benefit of this class that struct yp2_filter_struct exists,
and that all the filter classes provide a static object of that type.

yp2::filter::Base
-----------------

The virtual base class of all filters.  The filter API is, on the
surface at least, extremely simple: two methods.  configure() is
passed a DOM tree representing that part of the configuration file
that pertains to this filter instance, and is expected to walk that
tree extracting relevant information.  And process() processes a
Package (see below).  That surface simplicitly is a bit misleading, as
process() needs to know a lot about the Package class in order to do
anything useful.

yp2::filter::AuthSimple, Backend_test, FrontendNet, etc.
--------------------------------------------------------

Individual filters.  Each of these is implemented by a header and a
source file, named filter_*.hpp and filter_*.cpp respectively.  All
the header files should be pretty much identical, in that they declare
the class, including a private Rep class and a member pointer to it,
and the two public methods.  The only extra information in any filter
header is additional private types and members (the latter should
really all be in the Rep anyway).

The source file for each filter needs to supply:
- a definition of the private Rep class
- some boilerplate constructors and destructors
- a configure() method that uses the appropriate XML fragment
- most important, the prcoess() method that does all the actual work.

In a better world, each of the filters (nine so far) would be
documented separately.  Very, very briefly, though:
- auth_simple: authentication against a plain-text file
- backend_test: trivial ztest-like dummy hardwired back-end
- frontend_net: receives incoming Z39.50 and SRW PSUs
- log: writes log messages
- multi: fans out searches to multiple back-ends
- session_shared: global sharing of cached result-sets
- template: NOT TO BE USED: just a template source file for new filters
- virt_db: chooses which server/db to use based on database name
- z3950_client: forwards PDUs to a nominated Z39.50 server

### What is "filter_dl.cpp"?  It's to do with dynamic loading, but in
what way and to what extent does it function as a filter?

See the file "filters" for more information.


yp2::Package
------------

Represents a package on its way through the series of filters that
make up a route.  This is essentially a Z39.50 or SRU APDU together
with information about where it came from, which is modified as it
passes through the various filters.


yp2::Pipe
---------

This class provides a compatibility layer so that we have an IPC
mechanism that works the same under Unix and Windows.  It's not
particularly exciting.


yp2::Router and yp2::RouterChain
--------------------------------

###


yp2::RouterFleXML
-----------------

###


yp2::Session
------------

###

yp2::ThreadPoolSocketObserver
-----------------------------

###

yp2::util
---------

A namespace of various small utility functions and classes, collected
together for convenience.  Most importantly, includes the
yp2::util::odr class, a wrapper for YAZ's ODR facilities.


yp2::xml
---------

A namespace of various XML utility functions and classes, collected
together for convenience.


Other Source Files
==================

ex_router_flexml.cpp -- the main function of the proxy.
yp2_prog.cpp -- identical to the above: it's not clear why.
test_*.cpp -- unit-tests for various modules.
