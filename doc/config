The Guerilla Guide to Configuring YP2
=====================================

Introduction: invocation, schema and namespace
----------------------------------------------

YP2 configuration is by means of a single XML file, the name of which
is supplied as the sole command-line argument to the "yp2" binary.
This document briefly describes the format of that configuration file.

An XML schema, config.xsd, is provided for validating configuration
files.  It can be used by (among other tools) the "xmllint" program
supplied as part of the libxml2 distribution:

	xmllint --noout --schema config.xsd config1.xml

(A recent version of libxml2 is required, as support for XML Schemas
is a relatively recent addition.)

All elements and attributes are in the namespace
	http://indexdata.dk/yp2/config/1
This is most easily achieved by setting the default namespace on the
top-level element, as here:

	<yp2 xmlns="http://indexdata.dk/yp2/config/1">


Overview of XML structure
-------------------------

The top-level element is <yp2>.  This contains a <start> element, a
<filters> element and a <routes> element, in that order.  <filters> is
optional; the other two are mandatory.  All three are non-repeatable.

<start> is empty, but carries a "route" attribute, whose value is the
name of route at which to start running -- a bit like the name of the
start production in a grammar.

If present, <filters> contains zero or more <filter> elements; filters
carry a "type" attribute and contain various elements that provide
suitable configuration for filters of that type.  The filter-specific
elements are described below.  Filters defined in this part of the
file must carry an "id" attribute so that they can be referenced from
elsewhere.

<routes> contains zero or more <route> elements, each of which must
carry an "id" element.  One of the routes must have the id that was
specified for the start route in the <start> element's "route"
attribute.  Each route contains zero or more <filter> elements.  These
are of two types.  They may be empty, but carry a "refid" attribute
whose value is the same as the "id" of a filter previously defined in
the <filters> section.  Alternatively, a route within a filter may
omit the "refid" attribute, but contain configuration elements similar
to those used for filters defined in the <filters> section.
